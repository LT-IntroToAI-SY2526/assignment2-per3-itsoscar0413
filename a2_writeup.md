# Assignment 2 - Write UP
# Oscar Huerta

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

# I didn't find anything that difficult, but what I found confusing is the logic behind it. Especially with keeping up between what pind and sind means. I understand that they're a list and what they're doing and where they are, but just keeping up with it made me confused. But overall I did understand what was going on.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

# You could use the match function to extract information from a movie database as if a question is asked, it matches to the exact information that can be found within the database. It can help narrow down what information is needed to respond to the question, and give the results with precision and make the information accurate based on the database. For example, if someone wants to find movies from 2020, the match function can look for that year in the database and show only those movies. In summary, it helps narrow down what is being asked to give more specific answers based on the data within the databases.
